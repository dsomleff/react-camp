# React New Feature

## Hooks Notes
### useState()
1. useState() allow us to use state in functional components and this state is not suppose to be an object it can be a string or boolean.
2. useState() can be called multiple times.
3. Using/Updating useState() it completely replace what was before.

### useEffect()
- it's going to run once right away and it's going to run after changes to component state or props
- allows to synchronize props and state with whatever we want to
- using as second argument array with props, we can specify on what props changes useEffect should react
- empty array as second argument, allows use useEffect() only once, when page loaded
